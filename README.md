## Overview

- This project gave me the chance to practice my DOM Manipulation skills while having a refresher with my HTML and CSS styling and it seems to be coming easier every time. 
- I really enjoyed this project, It has been my favorite personal project besides from my portfolio.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Use calculator to its full extent 
- Select which themes they would like to view the app in
- Receive an accurate result of what needs to be calculated

### What I learned

In this project I really started improving and learning on best practices as well as cleaner code. I also advanced how I felt about JavaScript and understanding how the DOM can be something very strong to manipulate as well as how to learn to look at documentation. 

### Continued development

I will not continue to develop this app as it has already been completed to its full intentionally extent.
